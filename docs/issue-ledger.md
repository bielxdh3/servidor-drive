# Root.ark Issue Ledger

## Fresh control evidence addendum — 2026-08-13

Fresh exact-attachment evidence is linked at `docs/validation/2026-08-13-rootark-fresh-control-evidence.md`. The attachment is verified as 468 lines with SHA-256 `31822A11CACDC5B2693861F2CA945F0A895673F08E925EF1E66CBF4BE73B56DB`. Control-plane provenance is App Server thread `019ffb95-e675-76e1-ae22-a3129af79b5a`, latest fresh completed bounded turn `019ffcfa-d41d-7fc2-a80b-f8790578b6c1`, request `rootark-exact-attachment-20260813-fresh-c`; prior turn `019ffcf0-0977-7e43-a8a8-70065bb1f937` was an incomplete timed-out attempt only.

The linked artifact preserves the exact network diagnostics, per-command focused/full test-failure ledger, and historical rootark-zk-1 review. Its Phase 8 and 2026-08-13 Phase 9 status statements are historical evidence; the current Phase 9/10 transition is recorded below. Phase 15 remains `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` with `RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` wording preserved, and publication authorization remains separately bounded. The two named `.codex-fresh-cache-20260813-b` and `.codex-fresh-install-20260813-b` directories were exact-scope inspected, removed, and verified absent without targeting user data or unrelated dirty changes.

Reconciled locally on 2026-08-13 against the verified canonical baseline `Root/main` at `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`. The authorized commits, branches, and draft PRs are recorded in `PUBLICATION_RECONCILIATION`; no issue-state or repository-setting mutation occurred.

| Issue | State | Evidence / remaining boundary |
|---:|---|---|
| #1 | `historical-complete` | JWT/startup/XSS stabilization remains covered by current focused tests and security documents; no reimplementation. |
| #2 | `historical-complete` | Cookie sessions, CSRF, realtime Origin/freshness, revocation, and expiry remain covered; current auth suite passed 13/13. |
| #3 | `historical-complete` | Validation/CI/dependency baseline is preserved; exact current local test evidence is recorded per phase. |
| #4 | `open-current` | Product discovery decisions D-001–D-009 are recorded, but branding and remaining product-policy questions still require owner confirmation. |
| #5 | `open-current` | Realtime and upload scanning boundaries are now bounded locally, and the zero-knowledge architecture/migration contract is drafted as a bounded design; WebDAV, full persistence parity, implementation, acceptance, and remote closure remain open. |
| #6 | `reconciled-locally` | `docs/roadmap/phase-11-backlog-reconciliation.md` records `PHASE_11_BACKLOG_RECONCILED` as a complete nine-item mapping. Issue #6 candidates remain non-commitments; every approved feature still requires prerequisites, owner decisions, and a separate issue. No feature was silently approved. |
| #7 | `historical-complete` | Operational report is preserved with PASS/BLOCKED distinctions; live ClamAV, OS mount, external providers, and production behavior remain environmental limits. |
| #8 | `historical-complete` | Governance/source-of-truth documents are preserved and synchronized locally where stale branch claims affected execution. |
| #9 | `accepted-locally` | `PHASE_10_TOTP_IMPLEMENTED_AND_SECURITY_REVIEW_APPROVED` is the local engineering verdict for the bounded Phase 10 implementation and final hardening correction. Independent evidence is 52/52 focused auth/TOTP/security tests, 616/616 broad `npm.cmd test` in 38.2 seconds, syntax 88/88, runtime artifacts, `npm ci --dry-run`, `git diff --check`, and targeted secret scan passing; the subsequent fail-closed policy-configuration correction passed the broader auth/TOTP/security regression matrix at 51/51. `npm audit` remains non-clean only for the pre-existing high `brace-expansion` advisory. Remote issue/publication state, Draft PR/merge state, browser/provider/production/remote-CI/release gates remain untouched or open. |
| #10 | `closure-ready-local` | D-001's current independent Root.ark/BielOS boundary and technical relationship contract are documented and closure-ready locally; future integration, migration, identity, and key relationships remain a separate owner-dependent project. Remote issue closure remains unclaimed because remote mutation is prohibited in this packet; no remote state is inferred. |
| #11 | `historical-complete` | Bounded security inventory is historical evidence; changed-boundary reviews were focused rather than broad rescans. |
| #12 | `historical-complete` | Release discipline and evidence-before-DONE rules remain active; the authorized draft publication record is preserved below. |
| #13 | `discarded` | Historical placeholder; no implementation required. |
| #14 | `closure-ready-local` | Root/main and canonical SHA are verified locally and stale local references were corrected. The technical branch/default-state work is closure-ready locally; remote issue closure remains unclaimed because remote mutation is prohibited in this packet, and no remote state is inferred. |
| #15 | `historical-complete` | Governance review is historical evidence; review/correction discipline remains active. |

## Phase 9/10 local transition — 2026-08-16

The current local engineering verdict is **`PHASE_9_BOUNDED_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTED`** for the bounded Phase 9 foundation and **`PHASE_10_TOTP_IMPLEMENTED_AND_SECURITY_REVIEW_APPROVED`** for Issue #9. Final independent Phase 10 evidence is 52/52 focused auth/TOTP/security tests, 616/616 broad `npm.cmd test` in 38.2 seconds, syntax 88/88, runtime artifacts, `npm ci --dry-run`, `git diff --check`, and targeted secret scan passing; the subsequent fail-closed policy-configuration correction passed the broader auth/TOTP/security regression matrix at 51/51. `npm audit` remains non-clean only for the pre-existing high `brace-expansion` advisory. The future-iat fixture was widened from +301s to +600s as a test-only timing-margin correction, with production behavior unchanged. Bounded HTTP integration evidence also passed.

Issue #9 is accepted locally within this engineering scope. This does not close the remote issue, publish or change the Draft PR state, merge, establish browser/provider/production/remote-CI/release acceptance, or claim production readiness. The dated sections below preserve their historical status at the time they were written and are not remote-closure evidence.

## Phase 11 backlog reconciliation — 2026-08-16

Local engineering verdict: **`PHASE_11_BACKLOG_RECONCILED`** at starting SHA `76f2a02cf6e3872ab2d7b61ff617021daf893c61` on `cdx/rootark-phase11-backlog-reconciliation`. The canonical nine-item matrix is `docs/roadmap/phase-11-backlog-reconciliation.md`.

The matrix reconciles Issue #6 candidates as non-commitments and requires a separate future issue for each approved feature. TOTP is reconciled by the accepted Phase 10 record. Bidirectional synchronization and WebDAV mutations target Phase 12; search, previews, PWA/clients, groups, and admin UX target Phase 13; deployment prerequisites target Phase 14; naming and branding remain an owner/product decision. No Phase 12+ implementation occurred in that reconciliation turn; remote issue mutation, PR mutation, publication, merge, deploy, or release action also did not occur.

## Phase 12 local implementation — 2026-08-16

The bounded Phase 12 implementation is present at starting SHA
`730f581dd262ef0a21a1e73a9b3fc95149e68c63` on
`cdx/rootark-phase12-zk-sync-webdav`. It adds the versioned client envelope,
durable journal, loopback local bridge, and server-blind opaque object route.
Focused tests cover protocol/AAD, journal restart, bridge safety/trash, route
conflict/replay behavior, and the authenticated DELETE tombstone endpoint. The
independent bounded Phase 12 focused gate passed 65/65; the local executable
slice passes 4/4. The server never decrypts or receives file keys, and existing
public WebDAV route shapes were not changed.

Local status is **`PHASE_12_ACCEPTED_LOCAL`** for the bounded implementation and
focused gate. Dependency-backed broader repository regressions, provider,
browser, production, deployment, release, remote publication, and independent
Phase 16 review remain outside this branch and unclaimed.

## Phase 13 local implementation — 2026-08-16

The bounded Phase 13 client UX slice is implemented from exact Phase 12 SHA
`55e7d8a851aeca95f4a2d69a3bee3ebc0bdfba06` on
`cdx/rootark-phase13-client-ux`. It adds protected AES-256-GCM client index and
preview services with local decrypt-before-search, an opaque sync adapter, a
public-shell PWA/service worker with protected-path exclusions, an encrypted
client-local offline queue boundary, additive group CRUD/membership and folder
group access, and minimal admin/client UI wiring. The focused Phase 13 test
file is the local evidence for these boundaries; browser install and
provider/production validation remain unclaimed.

## Phase 14 local implementation — 2026-08-16

The bounded Phase 14 deployment/resilience slice is implemented from exact
Phase 13 SHA `d1fe80ea921f3b72bc34e1476c930e468a722df6` on
`cdx/rootark-phase14-deployment-resilience`. It adds sanitized unauthenticated
`/health` and fail-closed `/ready` checks, provider-error normalization,
bounded retry/cancellation and idempotency helpers, secret-safe observability
sanitization, and ciphertext-only sync backup/restore attestation integrated
with restart, backup, and restore validation. Existing backup/trash/version
contracts and route shapes are preserved. Focused failure-mode evidence is
recorded in `test/phase14-deployment-resilience.test.js`; dependency-backed,
native-binding, provider, TLS, production, remote CI, browser, publication,
and release acceptance remain unclaimed.

## Phase 15 local release gate — 2026-08-16

The bounded gate is implemented from exact Phase 14 SHA
`bcf0861e3c6987331228816cb479ade525b3b555`. The release-candidate lockfile
now resolves `brace-expansion` 5.0.9 with the previously reviewed official
registry integrity; `package.json` dependency parity is preserved and no new
dependency was added. High-severity lockfile audit evidence is clean in the
controlled disposable install.

The focused runner records **13 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 BLOCKED** before the required
local commit. The sole block is the intentional clean-worktree check. Phase 9
crypto, Phase 10 auth/TOTP, Phase 12 sync/WebDAV, Phase 13 client/groups,
Phase 14 readiness/ciphertext-only attestation, and disposable backup/restore
evidence pass through their focused boundaries. Ciphertext-only evidence
accepts a disposable protected record and rejects plaintext/key injection.

Current verdict: **`RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`** for release purposes.
Provider interoperability and credentials, browser/device behavior, live
production/TLS/rollback, final remote CI, product approval, publication, and
independent Phase 16 review remain explicit external residuals. No release,
tag, deploy, merge, push, PR, issue, or repository-setting mutation is
claimed.

## Current local gate

The previously dirty scoped implementation/test/documentation work is now organized into the authorized commit set across five published branches and their draft PRs. The source branch `cdx/rootark-roadmap` is clean and exactly at the `Root/main` baseline SHA `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`; this was achieved by branch organization and commits, not reset, clean, discard, or destructive cleanup. No merge, release, tag, deploy, force-push, destructive remote action, issue-state mutation, or repository-setting mutation occurred. Remaining work is gated by dependency/network recovery, zero-knowledge implementation and owner decisions, WebDAV and full persistence parity, native/provider/production evidence, and draft-PR review.

## Phase 8 independent security closure — 2026-08-14

The closure report is `docs/validation/2026-08-14-rootark-phase8-independent-security-closure.md`. It records live PR #54 provenance (`cdx/rootark-roadmap-evidence`, baseline docs head `4a604e43a57ba8368fca35e72ff10dff4e271c71`, `https://github.com/bielxdh3/root.ark/pull/54`), the fresh attacker matrix, active COSE-HPKE draft correction, direct RFC 9180 envelope profile, exact Ed25519 authorization bytes, deterministic CBOR/parser rules, wrap nonce decision, provenance matrix, and Phase 9 entry criteria.

Verdict: **`PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION`**. Phase 8 is `ACCEPTED`; Phase 9 is separately authorized but `NOT_STARTED`; Phase 15 remains `RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`. No Phase 9 foundation, runtime cryptography, dependency, lockfile, migration, or test implementation was executed.

Closure classifications now reflect the accepted design gate: executable proof, interoperability, recovery, bridge, migration, backup, and runtime evidence are `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_REQUIREMENT`; provider/browser/CI/production/native checks are `ENVIRONMENT_DEPENDENT_VALIDATION`; sharing/public-link UX, recovery authority, migration window/UX, sync conflict UX, and remaining 2FA policy are `GENUINE_OWNER_DECISION`; unavoidable recipient copies and metadata/traffic leakage are `RESIDUAL_ACCEPTED_RISK`. No current closure classification blocks the accepted Phase 8 gate or requires further technical correction.

## PUBLICATION_RECONCILIATION

The authorized commit set was published across five separate branches as draft PRs, all based on `Root/main` baseline SHA `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`. The `Refs #N` wording is preserved for each PR reference.

All five PRs are draft. PR #50 is the separate brace-expansion 5.0.9 lockfile hardening; its branch audit is clean. The unmerged source baseline remains affected by the brace-expansion advisory. Remote CI is `CONFIRMED_PARTIAL_CI_BLOCKED_ADVISORY` as recorded in `REMOTE_CI_ADDENDUM`; provider, browser, production, and cryptographic validation remain unconfirmed or blocked. No merge, release, tag, deploy, force-push, destructive remote action, issue-state mutation, or repository-setting mutation occurred.

## REMOTE_CI_ADDENDUM — 2026-08-13

PR #53 run [31749509029](https://github.com/bielxdh3/root.ark/actions/runs/31749509029) on commit `66a0133cbe39722950c2f34a9639a6e7e54adc7c` provides `CONFIRMED_PARTIAL_CI_BLOCKED_ADVISORY` evidence. Windows Node 22 [succeeded](https://github.com/bielxdh3/root.ark/actions/runs/31749509029/job/94611829759) through install, syntax, automated tests, artifacts, and clean checkout. Ubuntu Node 22 [succeeded through install, syntax, automated tests, and artifacts](https://github.com/bielxdh3/root.ark/actions/runs/31749509029/job/94611829806), then full validation failed only at Audit locked dependencies because `npm run validate:dependencies` reported one high `GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895` brace-expansion 5.0.8 advisory. This confirms partial remote CI only; it does not establish release readiness. Provider, browser, production, and cryptographic validation remain unconfirmed or blocked.

## Master phase ledger (original Phase 0-16 numbering)

The continuation governing this correction supplies the authoritative original meanings for Phases 0-16. Statuses below classify only the local evidence and remaining work; they do not convert historical, local, or design evidence into product acceptance.

Primary Phase 0-16 statuses use only `ACCEPTED`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED_OWNER_DECISION`, `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`, `BLOCKED_PUBLICATION_AUTHORIZATION`, `FAIL_CLOSED`, or `NOT_STARTED`. Detailed evidence and descriptive qualifiers remain secondary text.

| Phase | Original meaning | Status | Evidence | Remaining dependency | Next action |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Orientation/baseline | `ACCEPTED` | Starting SHA `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`, verified `Root/main`, source branch clean after scoped work was organized into published branches and commits | No reset, clean, discard, destructive cleanup, or baseline rewrite; provenance must remain explicit | Keep every continuation report anchored to the verified SHA and publication-state map |
| 1 | Historical evidence | `PARTIAL` | Issue #7 report records 21 `PASS`, 0 `FAIL`, 2 environmental `BLOCKED`; Issue #7 ledger state is historical-complete | Fresh rerun, live ClamAV, OS mount, providers, production behavior remain unclaimed | Preserve historical evidence and rerun only with disposable capabilities |
| 2 | Issue #14 | `ACCEPTED` | `Root/main`, `origin/HEAD`, and canonical SHA are locally verified; stale branch references were corrected | Remote issue state was not mutated and is not inferred | Leave remote Issue #14 untouched; report technical closure separately |
| 3 | Realtime contract tests | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Fresh focused run reached 33 tests: 19 passed and 14 failed on dependency-loading `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors; prior 7/7 evidence remains historical/local only | Complete disposable dependency install; buffered-client closure remains unverified | Re-run the focused suite after registry and dependency recovery |
| 4 | Realtime auth/notifications extraction | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Source boundary remains bounded, but fresh realtime/auth execution could not load `bcryptjs`; no fresh runtime acceptance is claimed | Complete dependencies, browser, CI, buffered-client, and production evidence remain open | Re-run runtime boundary tests after dependency recovery |
| 5 | Bounded architecture extraction | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Source and prior local contracts remain preserved; fresh focused execution was blocked by missing `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `better-sqlite3` | Complete dependencies, chunked/WebDAV/provider parity, live ClamAV, OS mount, and lifecycle proof remain open | Re-run bounded suites after dependency recovery |
| 6 | JSON/SQLite parity | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Targeted prior 70/70 evidence remains historical; fresh SQLite tests could not load `better-sqlite3`, and disposable install did not complete | Complete native dependency, full semantic parity, migration/restart, rollback, and production SQLite policy remain open | Run the disposable parity matrix after native dependency recovery |
| 7 | Product discovery and Root.ark/BielOS contract | `PARTIAL` | `docs/architecture/rootark-bielos-relationship-contract.md` records independent systems and no automatic sharing; Issue #10 is closure-ready-local | Future integration, migration, identity, and key relationships require owner approval; remote issue untouched | Keep Root.ark and BielOS independent until separately approved |
| 8 | Zero-knowledge architecture/migration | `ACCEPTED` | `docs/architecture/zero-knowledge-migration-contract.md` and `docs/validation/2026-08-14-rootark-phase8-independent-security-closure.md` freeze the protocol profile, attacker matrix, candidate policy, owner decisions, and verdict `PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION` | Phase 9+ vectors, implementation, migration, environment validation, and release acceptance remain open | Begin only the separately authorized bounded Phase 9 foundation; do not claim runtime or release readiness |
| 9 | Zero-knowledge implementation program | `ACCEPTED` | `PHASE_9_BOUNDED_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTED`: the bounded `rootark-zk-1` foundation and vectors are accepted locally; full zero-knowledge migration/runtime/release behavior remains outside scope | Reproducibility/provenance, migration/runtime, provider/browser/CI/production, and independent release evidence remain open | Preserve the bounded foundation and hand off full implementation only through a separately scoped phase |
| 10 | Issue #9 2FA/TOTP | `ACCEPTED` | `PHASE_10_TOTP_IMPLEMENTED_AND_SECURITY_REVIEW_APPROVED`: TOTP enrollment, challenge, recovery, disable/reset, policy, migration, session/realtime fencing, 52/52 focused auth/TOTP/security tests, 616/616 broad tests in 38.2 seconds, syntax 88/88, artifact/install/diff/secret gates, and bounded HTTP evidence are recorded locally | Browser, provider, production, remote-CI, release, and publication gates remain open; the pre-existing high `brace-expansion` advisory remains | Keep remote issue/publication and Draft PR state untouched; complete environment and release gates separately |
| 11 | Issue #6 backlog reconciliation | `ACCEPTED` | `PHASE_11_BACKLOG_RECONCILED`: `docs/roadmap/phase-11-backlog-reconciliation.md` contains the complete nine-item evidence and boundary matrix; candidates remain non-commitments and each approved feature requires a separate issue | Stabilization, product decisions, security review, and scoped issues remain prerequisites for any future implementation | Keep all candidates gated; begin only a separately approved feature issue |
| 12 | Bidirectional sync/WebDAV bridge | `ACCEPTED` | `PHASE_12_ACCEPTED_LOCAL`: versioned client protocol, durable journal, loopback bridge, opaque `/sync/v1/objects` routes including DELETE tombstones, and an independent 65/65 focused gate are recorded locally | Dependency-backed broader regression, provider/browser/production, deployment, release, and independent review evidence remain open | Preserve the bounded implementation and hand off deployment/release/review separately |
| 13 | Search/previews/PWA/clients/groups/admin UX | `PARTIAL` | Local Phase 13 slice is implemented at the exact Phase 12 baseline: protected client index/preview, opaque adapter, public-shell PWA, encrypted offline queue boundary, group routes/folder membership, focused UI wiring, and focused tests | Browser install, real offline replay/conflicts, provider/production, and independent review remain open; server-side protected plaintext search/preview is intentionally not implemented | Preserve the frozen boundary and complete environment-specific validation separately |
| 14 | Deployment/adapters/resilience | `IMPLEMENTED-UNVERIFIED` | Bounded local guards, sanitized health/readiness routes, provider normalization/retry/cancellation/idempotency helpers, secret-safe observability, and ciphertext-only sync backup/restore attestation are implemented; focused failure-mode evidence is recorded locally | Dependency, native-binding, provider, TLS, production, browser, remote CI, and release acceptance remain open; remote Issue #14 was not mutated | Run the final focused/regression/artifact/secret gates, then reassess local acceptance |
| 15 | Documentation/release gate | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | The local release gate is blocked by incomplete dependency/network, native-binding, provider, and production evidence; remote CI is confirmed partial and advisory-blocked, while documentation and secret-scan checks passed locally | Deployment exposure, product approval, and publication authorization remain separate open boundaries | Recover the environment and complete release evidence; seek publication authorization separately |
| 16 | Independent security/quality review | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Architect review found no concrete source defect; residual runtime/provider/production risks remain unvalidated because the fresh dependency gate is blocked | Independent final review, complete validation, and quality gate evidence remain outstanding | Repeat final security/quality review after dependency recovery |

## Phase 8 technical status addendum (2026-08-13)

Phase 8 is `ACCEPTED`: the zero-knowledge contract contains the complete bounded design, covering standards-based primitives, the proposed/reviewed client crypto-module boundary, key hierarchy, envelope/AAD/version registry, device/recovery lifecycle, derived data, sharing, backup/erasure, local WebDAV bridge, sync, migration/rollback, fixtures, and failure classification. Phase 9 is separately authorized but `NOT_STARTED`; no crypto implementation, migration, dependency, runtime, test, or package change was made. Current server-readable behavior remains legacy and is not zero-knowledge evidence.

## Phase 8 closure gate addendum — 2026-08-14

The fresh independent correction is now frozen as the accepted Phase 8 design: `draft-ietf-cose-hpke-26` is active work in progress; final RFC 9180 HPKE is used directly behind an explicit Root.ark deterministic CBOR envelope; final RFC 9052/9864 semantics are the only permitted COSE references; HPKE base mode is recipient-only and requires the exact Ed25519 manifest signature input; RFC 8949 deterministic parser rejection is mandatory; the one-shot CER wrapping construction eliminates a durable nonce ledger; and the libsodium-wrappers-sumo Argon2id policy is parameterized without installation or production claims. Vectors, interoperability, implementation, and environment evidence are Phase 9+/release work.

Phase 9 entry is separately authorized for a bounded foundation but remains `NOT_STARTED`. Phase 9+ requires exact vectors and interoperability, implementation of the frozen wrap construction, candidate/provenance execution, owner policy handling, negative/fuzz/property coverage, device/recovery/rotation/compromise evidence, bridge crash safety, migration rollback/downgrade resistance, ciphertext-only backup/restore proof, and available provider/browser/CI/production validation. Verdict is `PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION`; no Phase 9 foundation was executed.

## PHASE_9_FOUNDATION_WORK — 2026-08-14

The same biel4 App Server Executor, turn `01a00094-8b4e-7ba1-b84b-aee6b50b015f`, attempted the separately authorized foundation on `cdx/rootark-zk-foundation` from baseline `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`. The branch was clean; npm metadata acquisition for `@hpke/core` 1.9.0, `@hpke/dhkem-x25519` 1.8.0, `libsodium-wrappers-sumo` 0.8.4, and a strict deterministic-CBOR dependency timed out after 30 seconds. Status: **`PHASE_9_FOUNDATION_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT_DEPENDENCIES`**. No package, lockfile, source, test, crypto, or production-route file changed; no partial/homegrown crypto, commit, push, or PR was made for the empty foundation branch. Phase 8 remains **`PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION`** / `ACCEPTED`; Phase 9 remains `NOT_STARTED`; Phase 15 remains `RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`. Retry only when the same Executor has reproducible registry access.

## Local diagnostic classifications (2026-08-13)

These are independent local execution classifications. None is a publication authorization decision, and no further remote mutation is claimed in this reconciliation.

| Boundary | Classification | Safe evidence | Meaning and next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linked-worktree Git metadata | `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_GIT_ACL` | `E:\servidor-roadmap\.git` points to `E:\servidor\.git\worktrees\servidor-roadmap`; the common object store is `E:\servidor\.git`. `git worktree list --porcelain` shows no live lock files; `git cat-file -e HEAD` succeeds. Read-only ACL inspection found no deny entry for the active `codexsandboxoffline` account, but metadata/object write behavior remains unsafe to change. | No safe ACL repair was applied because no active-account deny was proven and broad ownership/permission changes are prohibited. Preserve the worktree and classify the write boundary as environment-blocked. |
| npm install/toolchain | `BLOCKED_TOOLCHAIN_DEPENDENCY_INSTALL` | Node `v24.14.1`, npm `11.11.0`, lockfile version 3 with 378 locked packages, absent `node_modules`, and missing `bcryptjs`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, and `better-sqlite3`. DNS resolves `registry.npmjs.org`, but TCP/HTTPS 443 connectivity fails. A disposable cache/install was attempted; `npm.cmd ci` timed out after 120 seconds and did not produce usable dependencies. | The dependency tree is incomplete. This is an environment/network boundary, not a source regression; retry only with a functioning disposable install path. |

## Continuation authorization addendum — 2026-08-13

The documentation-only continuation report is `docs/validation/2026-08-13-rootark-continuation-master-report.md`. Trusted-wrapper provenance records executor `biel4`, backend `app_server`, branch `cdx/rootark-roadmap`, base SHA `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`, App Server thread `019ffb95-e675-76e1-ae22-a3129af79b5a`, current provenance turn `019ffd1b-057f-73a3-a53b-1619612ff2e8`, process `21208`, `reuse_existing=false`, and `app_server` task transport; this is wrapper provenance, not model text. The authorized commits, branches, and draft PRs are listed in `PUBLICATION_RECONCILIATION`; no merge, release, tag, deploy, force-push, destructive remote, issue-state, or repository-setting action occurred.

Rootark-zk-1 is **accepted for the bounded Phase 9 foundation**; the independent closure verdict is **`PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION`**. Remaining boundaries are Phase 9+ implementation acceptance, genuine owner decisions for sharing UX/expiry/recipient recovery, recovery authority, migration window/UX, sync conflict UX, and remaining 2FA policy, plus environment-dependent validation. Phase 9 remains not started and release readiness is not claimed.

Phase 8 is `ACCEPTED` with verdict `PHASE_8_ACCEPTED_FOR_BOUNDED_PHASE_9_FOUNDATION`; Phase 9 is separately authorized but `NOT_STARTED`; Phase 15 remains `RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`. No new zero-knowledge runtime implementation is claimed. Static checks remain recorded as passed (`node --check` on seven changed/new JavaScript files, `git diff --check`, and scoped secret scan with zero matches); dependency-backed tests remain blocked as documented in the fresh-control artifact. The five semantic commit families and draft PRs are recorded in `PUBLICATION_RECONCILIATION`. The unmerged source baseline audit returned exit 1 with one high transitive brace-expansion 5.0.8 advisory (`GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895`, CVE-class DoS) through `archiver -> readdir-glob -> minimatch` 10.2.6. PR #50 separately hardens the lockfile to brace-expansion 5.0.9, and its branch audit is clean; the unmerged source baseline remains advisory-affected. The fixed repair target is brace-expansion 5.0.9 with official integrity `sha512-ScQ4IuvIEF1TMlP7Zt+vjJ//9zlPb2SDcxWxM3bk8s6t6GGdJ7KO1dCcTidOPJKePW30LE/2cT7wCyPho9/Wxg==`. The online audit-fix attempt failed with registry/cache EPERM, and the required offline lockfile-only attempt returned exit 0 without changing the source-baseline `package-lock.json`. Classify this as `SECURITY_DEPENDENCY_ADVISORY` plus `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT_TOOLCHAIN_REPAIR`, not as a clean audit or a generic advisory-endpoint absence.

## ARCHITECT DIFF REVIEW

Independent review of the reconciled scoped changes found no concrete source defect requiring a correction packet. The bounded realtime/upload changes retain their documented adapters and security boundaries; documentation and architecture changes preserve the independent Root.ark/BielOS and zero-knowledge limitations. Remote CI is confirmed partial but advisory-blocked in `REMOTE_CI_ADDENDUM`; residual risks include unproven native SQLite, providers, browser/production behavior, full parity, and zero-knowledge implementation/migration acceptance.

## LOCAL COMMITS

The authorized commit set across five draft PRs is recorded in `PUBLICATION_RECONCILIATION`. HEAD remains anchored to baseline `28747c6ebdac873650e2d5a3c6193824e7cc9985`; no commit was amended or rewritten.

## FRESH VALIDATION MATRIX

| Command | Result | Exact evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `node scripts/validate-syntax.js` | PASS | 83 checked, 0 failed; exit 0. |
| `node scripts/validate-runtime-artifacts.js` | PASS | Protected artifact guard passed; exit 0. |
| Scoped secret scan | PASS | 9 scoped source/test/ledger/validation targets scanned; 0 sensitive-pattern matches. |
| Focused realtime/auth/upload/cloud/WebDAV/SQLite run | ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED | 33 tests: 19 passed, 14 failed on dependency-loading `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors for `bcryptjs`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, and `better-sqlite3`. |
| `npm.cmd test -- --test-reporter=tap` | ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED | 106 tests: 34 passed, 72 failed; repository `node_modules` was absent and failures were dependency-loading failures. |
| `npm.cmd audit --package-lock-only --audit-level=high` | `SECURITY_DEPENDENCY_ADVISORY` plus `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT_TOOLCHAIN_REPAIR` | Exit 1 against the unmerged source baseline; one high brace-expansion 5.0.8 advisory remains. PR #50 separately hardens the lockfile to 5.0.9 and its branch audit is clean. |
| `npm.cmd run validate` | ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED | Exit 1 after syntax passed and dependency-missing test stage failed. |
| `git diff --check` | PASS | Exit 0. |

No concrete source defect was identified in the fresh failures.

## RELEASE GATE

`RELEASE_GATE_BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT`: syntax, artifacts, secret scan, and whitespace checks pass, but dependency installation, native SQLite, focused/runtime acceptance, audit, CI, provider, production, and exact release authorization are incomplete. Six authorized commits across five draft PRs are recorded above; no merge, release, tag, deploy, force-push, destructive remote action, issue-state mutation, or repository-setting mutation occurred.

## FINAL SECURITY/QUALITY REVIEW

Security/quality verdict: **Approved with reservations** for local documentation and evidence reconciliation only. Authentication, authorization, path containment, quarantine, WebDAV journaling, storage isolation, audit exclusions, and independent Root.ark/BielOS boundaries remain preserved in the reviewed diff. No concrete source defect was found. Residual risks are the environment-blocked dependency/runtime gate, native/provider/production boundaries, full parity, browser/CI evidence, and zero-knowledge implementation/migration acceptance.

## NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION

Restore TCP/HTTPS access to `registry.npmjs.org` or provide an approved equivalent disposable package source, then rerun `npm.cmd ci` in a disposable cache/install root. If installation completes, run the focused matrix, `npm.cmd test`, `npm.cmd audit --package-lock-only --audit-level=high`, `npm.cmd run validate`, and `git diff --check`; only then reassess commit/release readiness. Do not change ACLs broadly or mutate remote state.
